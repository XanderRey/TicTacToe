## Game Rules

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns to mark a cell in the grid with their symbol (either X or O).
- The first player to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
- If all cells are filled and no player has aligned three symbols, the game ends in a tie.

## Usage

- When prompted, each player selects a cell number to place their symbol.
- The game alternates turns between players X and O.
- After each turn, the updated board is displayed.
- The game announces the winner or declares a tie when applicable.
